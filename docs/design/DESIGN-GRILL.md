# Design step: grilling record

The next step for Pieced is the look: cartoon up close ("Family Guy / Looney Tunes"), magical in the distance ("Harry Potter × Star Wars"), with guns that look like Fortnite guns but fire like spells. This file records each decision as Jake makes it.

## Round 1: settled 2026-09-25 (Jake: "rec on all")

| # | Decision | What it commits us to |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | **Milestone 1 is parked.** | The G2 performance bar carries into this step's done state. Jake's 10-minute feel verdict (G9) can happen at any time. The old-art sign-off (G8) is dropped because the new look replaces the old art. |
| D2 | **Concept images come from the Codex CLI in the background.** | Four style directions, two images each (`docs/design/concepts/`). Jake picks one direction, or mixes them. |
| D3 | **Spells change the visuals only.** | Gameplay stays hitscan, so time-to-kill, trackpad aiming and bot fairness don't change. Guns keep Fortnite-like silhouettes, with magical parts: crystals, runes, energy cells, brass. Every shot is a glowing spell bolt with a trail and a magical impact burst. |
| D4 | **Art is built with Blender scripts, plus code for simple things.** | Models are built by Blender Python scripts I write and iterate on without Jake, then exported for Bevy. Original assets only: no CC0 packs unless Jake approves them later. **Blender is not installed.** Installing it needs Jake's OK (see round 2). |
| D5 | **The performance line is hard.** | 60 fps on battery with Low Power Mode on the MacBook Air (G2 thresholds). The style must be cheap by design: toon shading, outlines, restrained glow and particles. |
| D6 | **Done state (draft).** | Jake picks a style from the images. The game is rebuilt in that style. Done when all four hold: Jake signs off a new 8-view gallery; the guns and spells feel "sick" to Jake; G2 holds; and the far view has life in it (e.g. ships passing, castles glowing). |

## Round 2: partial, 2026-09-25 (Jake, after seeing the 8 concepts)

| # | Decision | What it commits us to |
|---|---|---|
| D7 | **Style mix.** | **Close-up:** the C1/C2 flat TV-cartoon look (clean thin outlines, flat two-tone shading) mixed with Looney Tunes-style wizard characters. **Far view:** D1's background, a stained-glass cathedral space station over a swirling galaxy. |
| D8 | **Enemy.** | The B2 castle knight (armored battle-mage), redrawn in the close-up cartoon style with Looney-wizard flavor. |
| D9 | **Guns.** | Built like the A1/A2 chunky brass-and-crystal rifle. |
| D10 | **Spells.** | Like B1 and C1: a glowing blue orb or starburst bolt with a sparkle trail and a bright impact burst. |
| D11 | **Blender is approved.** | Jake wants help freeing disk space first; only about 5.5 GB is free. |

## Round 2: remaining questions

Still to ask:
- the building material theme (C's cartoon brick vs A's wood);
- the spell color language;
- far-vista composition and "life";
- outline technique;
- restyled HUD and audio;
